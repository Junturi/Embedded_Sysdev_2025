# Embedded\_Sysdev\_2025



Week 2 assignment was to get familiar with RTOS and tasks. We create tasks to blink colored LEDs (green, yellow, red) and create a state machine to handle the order of blinking the lights. Later on we will buttons to pause the light sequence and to turn the lights on or off manually.
