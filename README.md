# Embedded\_Sysdev\_2025



This repository holds all coding assignments from the course Sulautettujen j√§rjestelmien ohjelmistokehitys held during fall 2025 at Oulun Ammattikorkeakoulu.

Every assignment was divided in three parts.



## Week 1



No coding assignments on week 1.



## Week 2



Week 2 assignment was to get familiar with RTOS, tasks and state machines.



In part one, we create tasks to blink colored LEDs (green, yellow, red) and create a state machine to handle the order of blinking the lights.



In part two, we add a button, button\_0. When the button is pressed, the light sequence is paused. When pressed again, the light sequence will continue.



In part three, we add four more buttons. When the light sequence is paused, pressing buttons 1-3 will turn a LED on or off. Each button has different color: button\_1 is red, button\_2 is yellow, button\_3 is green. Button\_4 will start or stor blinking yellow light.
